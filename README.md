# cocoa-quality-detection
# Cocoa Quality Classifier with AI Feedback (Offline-First, Multimodal)
This project combines YOLOv8 for image classification and Gemma 3n for natural language feedback—running entirely offline to support cocoa farmers in low-connectivity regions.

## Key Features
Offline-First: No internet needed. All models run locally.

Multimodal AI: Combines vision and language—detects cocoa quality and explains the result in natural language.

Built with Gemma 3n: Uses the powerful, privacy-preserving language model for on-device generation.

## User Interfaces:

Command Line Interface (CLI) for fast predictions

(Optional) Flask web demo for local interface (if functional)

## Quickstart (CLI Version)
1. Install dependencies
pip install torch torchvision transformers ultralytics

2. Project structure


├── quality_best.pt               # YOLOv8 model (cocoa classification)
├── quality_scripted.pt (opt.)   # TorchScript version if using scripted
├── gemma_model.py               # Loads Gemma + response function
├── cli_app.py                   # Main CLI entry point
├── requirements.txt             # (Optional)
└── demo_images/
    └── sample.jpg

3. Run CLI

python cli_app.py "demo_images/sample.jpg"

## How It Works
Image Classification (YOLOv8):

Detects cocoa bean type (e.g., poor, good)

Text Generation (Gemma 3n):

Receives a prompt like:
“What does it mean if a cocoa bean is classified as good?”

Outputs AI explanation using natural language.


Example Output

Predicted class: poor

Gemma Response:

Poof cocoa beans indicate poor drying or improper storage, leading to fungal contamination. This affects flavor and safety.

## Included separately as CLI walk-through
Explains model pipeline, shows sample output, and demonstrates offline setup.

## Model Details
YOLOv8: Fine-tuned on annotated cocoa bean images (dry, good, moldy, broken)

Gemma 3n (2B): Loaded via Hugging Face Transformers locally

## Impact & Use Case
This app empowers cocoa producers to:

Visually assess bean quality

Understand implications with local AI explanation

Operate without internet, ensuring functionality in remote farming areas

## Future Improvements
Add local language support (Twi, Ewe)

Enable voice input and audio response

Extend to leaf disease detection and biodiversity tracking
